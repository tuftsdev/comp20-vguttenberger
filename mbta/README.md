1. All aspects correctly implemented. 
	Some things for the infowindows on stations
	should be better implemented/fixed, for example: 
		-the infowindow for one station doesn't close when another 
		is opened, 
		-the incoming train times are not in order by time 
		(ex. should be soonest to last, but it is
		currently all jumbled).
