<h1>Security Assessment of defense-in-derpth</h1>
<p> -Vera Guttenberger</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This project is a security assesment of https://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/, 
which is an application which allows users to check in at a certain latitude and 
longitude. I have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve
any security and privacy issues in this application, which is a Node.js + Express 
+ MongoDB web application. The app provides an API for users to submit their
checkins and offers an interface where the checkins are listed. However, there are
many vulnerabilities in this application which make it unusable. This document 
identifies those vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
To test, I carried out a combination of "black-box" and "white-box" testing. The 
former involves performing attacks without reading source code, after configuring
and running the application. The latter involves a code review and attacking the 
application after finding something suspicious in the code. The only tool I used
to do this was <code>curl</code>    
</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p>All the vulnerabilities in this application have to do with putting to
much trust in user input. Various vulnerabilities allow an attacker to submit
oddly formated login, lat, or lng input which can crash the website. It
also makes it easy for the attacker to view and tamper with the database. More
security must be in place to avoid these kinds of attacks and keep the
application from being spammed, or worse, user data from being exploited.</p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><h3><strong> Cross-Site Scripting</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Issue found: when POST is used on the /sendLocation page</li>
<li> Severity: High -- this flaw is very dangerous because it allows malicious
scripts to be injected into the application which may be trusted. The script
could be used to spam, or used for more malicious purposes like gathering
sensitive information. It may be used to bypass access controls. </li>
<li>Data submitted via the POST API is not escaped, so somebody can submit any HTML
or script in place of a "check in". It is easy to inject using curl,
for example executing <code>curl --data "login=< iframe src='http://www.nyan.cat/'></ iframe>&lat=11&lng=12" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation</code> or 
<code>curl --data "login=< iframe src='http://omfgdogs.com'>< /iframe>&lat=11&lng=12" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation</code> or <code>curl --data "login=< h1>HELLO< /h1>&lat=11&lng=12" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation</code> etc. will inject that into
the page. The result:
<img src="images/ScreenShot1.png" alt="xss" title="XSS"/>
</li>
<li>The issue of XSS can be resolved by escaping user input. You can escape HTML 
characters like (&, <, >, " , ') with encoding. You should also escape JavaScript,
JSON values, CSS, URLs. You should also use a library such as HtmlSanitizer to 
sanitize HTML Markup.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><h3><strong>Injection Attack</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Issue found: when GET is used on the /checkins.json page</li>
<li>Severity: High-- an injection attack is a huge security vulnerability
because it allows attackers to access or tamper with data. </li>
<li> An injection attack can be used to dump the contents of the database
to the attacker. For example, using [$ne], a negation query, like http://localhost:3000/checkins.json?login[$ne]=random, sends a JSON and obtains
access of all the data in the database:
<img src="images/ScreenShot2.png" alt="injection" title="Injection attack"/>
</li>
<li>
Ways injection attacks can be prevented: SQL injection can be avoided by 
implementing parametrized statements instead of embedding user input. Another
way is escaping, similarly to before, characters that have a certain meaning in SQL.
Another way is to limit database permissions. NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
in MongoDB can also be tested for.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><h3><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Issue found: on the /sendLocation page</li>
<li>Severity: Moderate-- Responding with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows the
requested resource to share with every origin. This is ill-advised because it is a 
big security risk, however it is easily avoided with implementing a different
CORS response. 
<li>
Setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to * basically assumes a wild card 
domain, meaning CORS can be used in any way. This allows for data leakage because it
means any site can send a request to the application and access the server's 
response. When you allow this type of resource sharing for every resource instead of selected resources, it poses a security risk because the requests triggered by 
the outside resource will be able to use any authentication implemented in the 
application. This wild card is generally not appropriate and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Issues with this application make it easy to abuse the interface and the data,
making the application untrustworthy and unusable. Following the recommendations given will lower vulnerability to attacks. Most changes are fairly easy to
implement. Even with these in place, and certain parameters in place that
allow only ceratin user input (ex. only strings allowed as logins and only
integers as coordinates), users can still enter any credentials, so it may
not be accurate. Besides that, the security vulnerabilities in this application 
are easily fixable. </a></p>
